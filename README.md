# Simple Map Generator

## About
This is a simple web-based map generator that uses the Diamond-Square algorithm to create random terrain maps.

## Diamond-Square Algorithm
The Diamond-Square algorithm is a method used to generate realistic-looking terrain. It works by dividing a space into smaller squares and diamonds, then randomly adjusting their heights to create variations. Over multiple iterations, this creates a terrain map.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Click the "Generate Map" button
